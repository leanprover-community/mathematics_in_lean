Differential Calculus
=====================

We now consider the formalization of notions from *analysis*,
starting with differentiation in this chapter
and turning integration and measure theory in the next.
In :numref:`elementary_differential_calculus`, we stick with the
setting of functions from the real numbers to the real numbers,
which is familiar from any introductory calculus class.
In :numref:`normed_spaces`, we then consider the notion of a derivative in
a much broader setting.
